Hi, my name is Jochen and I live in Zurich, Switzerland. I'm a systems and
software engineer with experience as a developer and team lead. I have a good
understanding of the whole infrastructure stack and how to automate each system
in it and combine all the pieces so that they play nicely together.

Over the years I learned a lot and I'm still learning new things every day. With
these posts I hope that I can pay it forward, as I learned so many things from
other people and hopefully I can prevent some of you from experiencing the same
pain I did :wink:

## Feedback
If you have questions or feedback to any of my posts, please don't hesitate to
get in touch with me. Even if you have a simple or in your opinion a _stupid_
question, don't hesitate to ask, as I'm more than willing to answer it.

Thanks for reading!
